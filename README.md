# nexus-backup
NexusBackup is a lightweight, offline-first backup utility designed for students, developers, and anyone who values privacy, control, and customization.

Unlike cloud sync tools like Google Drive or Dropbox, NexusBackup gives you full control over your files — locally, with no internet required, and backed by a modern Java-based GUI and CLI.

🚀 Features
✅ Custom backup schedules using Java’s ScheduledExecutorService

✅ Full system or folder-level backups

✅ Works 100% offline — no internet or cloud login needed

✅ Restore previous versions (Planned)

✅ Dual interface: Modern GUI (JavaFX) + Powerful CLI

✅ Dark mode, themes, and an Easter egg

✅ No file size limits — you decide how and where to back up

✅ Free and open-source — view, edit, or contribute

✅ Plugin system (Planned for extensibility)

🔧 Built With
Java (Standard Edition) – core logic and file handling

JavaFX – GUI design with support for themes and dark mode

Native Java Libraries – file copy (java.nio), compression (java.util.zip), scheduling (ScheduledExecutorService)
